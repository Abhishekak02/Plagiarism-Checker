# Plagiarism-Checker
Plagiarism is a serious academic offense that involves presenting someone else's work as one's own without proper attribution. In the digital age, with vast amounts of information available at our fingertips, the temptation to plagiarize has increased. To combat this issue and maintain academic integrity, plagiarism checkers have emerged as valuable tools. These software programs or online services are designed to analyse a given text and compare it with a database of existing sources to identify potential instances of plagiarism.
